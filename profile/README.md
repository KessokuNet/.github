# KessokuNet

> Downstream forks, patches and glue code held by zipties

KessokuNet is internal lab infrastructure for internal in our private guild setting.

Named after the *Kessoku band* from *Bocchi The Rock!!*, and also the fact the fragility of this codebase is held together by zipties.

These patches kept public so that anyone that finds these useful can adopt them. Just don't expect stability, we don't provide warranties, as per FOSS licensing standards.
